# Thermal-Effects-on-Air-Brake-Efficiency-Railway-Wagons
Thermal Effects on Air Brake Efficiency in Railway Wagons is a MATLAB-based simulation that studies how ambient temperature affects pneumatic air brake performance. It analyzes changes in air density, pressure wave speed, and brake response time, showing delayed braking in cold conditions and faster response in warmer climates.
